Simple non blocking server that support vector search algorithms (ANNOY, Vamana, HNSW, and Inverted File Index)

VectorSearchEngine.cpp contains code for setting up and configuring a server.

Client.cpp contains code for interacting with a server. 

Some of the code for the non blocking server is taken from https://build-your-own.org/redis/#table-of-contents.
